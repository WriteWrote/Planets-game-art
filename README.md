# Planets-game-art
Props for small indi-game

**Story:**
The main idea lays in concept of solar system, where exist the precious planets, which should be protected from invasion.
Each planet has a natural satellite.
For protecting a planet gamer should post a techno Protector-satellite. Protectors can be upgraded up to four level of toughness.

**Props:**
1. 9 different planets
2. 9 natural satellites divided by colour (should go together with the host-planet colour)
3. 4 levels of Protector-satellite
4. Sun - the center of battlefield )
5. Space-background

**Wishes:**
1. Original satellites for each type of planet
2. Planets with circles around them
3. four stages of Protector-satellite

**Progress:**
1. first seven planets
2. seven satellites for each planet
3. planned next 1 planets and stages of Protector-satellites are changed on one type of Protector, just coloured differently
NOTE: changes in plan: Protector-satellites will be as exemplares of one pattern, but with different colors. But the rest of simple satellites will have original shapes.

**ToDo:**
1. draw one more questionable planet
2. draw one half-Eden & half-destroyed planet
3. cosmic space
4. draw one type of Protector-satellite for prodaction
